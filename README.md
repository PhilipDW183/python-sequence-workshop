>***Author:*** Zhaoxuan "Tony" Wu, Head of _Science_ (20/21)

>***Difficulty***: 2/5 ~ 3/5

>***Prerequisite***: `PY01` or basic Python syntax. Experience with `list` and `tuple` is desirable, but we will take a closer look into the details.

## Description

In this workshop, we will be introduced the data structure `sequence` in Python and two examples: `list` and `tuple`. We will take a closer look into the methods provided, attributes, the APIs, the usage and some implementation details into these data structures, which should provide you with a thorough introduction to `list` and `tuple`. Even if you are familiar with the data structures, this workshop might be able to give you some insightful explanation of why things are done in some certain ways.

## Software Prerequisite
- Python 3
- Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook *(optional)*
